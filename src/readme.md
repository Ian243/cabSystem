## **_for Admin's Cab allocation**_ 

Let's summarize the problem statement :

**Problem Statement:**
The problem involves optimizing the paths of two or more cabs in a set of cities to cover specific stops and reach 
their respective destinations. The cabs start from opposite directions and each cover the stop nearest to them.
Once a stop is covered by one cab, it is excluded from the other cab's path.
The objective is to find the optimal paths for both cabs, considering distance optimization 
and meeting the exclusivity constraint on stops.

**Key Aspects:**
1. Two cabs start from opposite directions.
2. Each cab covers the stop nearest to its starting position initially.
3. Stops are exclusive to each cab; once covered, a stop is excluded from the other cab's path.
4. Both cabs reach their respective destinations after covering all stops.

**Approach:**
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The cities and distances between them are represented as a graph.
   - The graph is randomly generated with weights between cities.

2. **Optimization Algorithm:**
   - The optimization algorithm involves finding the nearest neighbor for each cab based on its current position 
   and the available stops.
   - The algorithm ensures that stops are exclusive to each cab, and the destination is reached after covering all stops.

3. **Path Printing and Distance Calculation:**
   - The code prints the optimal paths for both cabs, including the stops reached and the travel distance.
   - The total distance covered by both cabs is calculated and printed.

4. **Exclusivity Constraint:**
   - Stops are excluded from the other cab's path once covered, ensuring that each stop is visited by only one cab.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - The code is updated to handle potential errors, such as index out of bounds during initialization of cab positions.
  
**another approach:**
   1.Dijkstra's Algorithm:
    Apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from the initial positions of both cabs to all stops.
    Maintain a priority queue to explore the nearest neighbors first.
   2.Optimization Algorithm (Per Cab):
      For each cab:
         Start from the initial position.
         Use the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path to all stops.
         Choose the next stop as the one with the shortest path that has not been covered.
         Add the chosen stop to the cab's list of stops.

**Overall Process:**
1. Generate a graph representing cities and distances.
2. Initialize two cabs with opposite starting positions and destinations.
3. Find the optimal path for each cab, considering exclusivity and distance optimization.
4. Print the optimal paths, stops, and total distance covered by both cabs.

The implementation follows an object-oriented approach, utilizing classes for cities, edges, and cabs.
The main class orchestrates the optimization process for each cab, ensuring optimal paths with exclusivity and 
calculating total distances. The code has undergone iterative refinement to address errors and meet the 
specified requirements.

The iterative process involves refining the code based on feedback, addressing errors, and ensuring that the 
implementation meets the specified requirements.

a specific situation for above statement is travelling salesman problem, where a salesman should 
cover all the cities once in the minimum distance.

## **_for Employee's cab search optimization:_**
Let's summarize the problem statement:

**Problem Statement:**
The task is to find the first 5 nearest cabs to a randomly generated customer location using 
the Minkowski distance formula. The cabs are represented by their positions in a 2D space.
The code should print the positions of all cabs and then display the nearest cabs located near the 
randomly generated customer location.

**Java Solution:**
   - Created a class `NearestCabs` with methods for Minkowski distance calculation and finding the nearest cabs.
   - Generated a random customer location and a random cabs dataset within the `main` method.
   - Displayed the positions of all cabs and the nearest 5 cabs in Java.

solution uses the Minkowski distance formula, which is a generalization of distance metrics.
The problem simulates finding the nearest cabs to a randomly placed customer in a 2D space.
The code emphasizes modularity, with functions for distance calculation and finding the nearest cabs.
The main methods generate random inputs, print cab positions, and display the nearest cabs.

there is another solution I have searched for admin cab allocation which uses the or tools to find the optimized path
for a fleet of vehicles with a common destination point and multiple stops.
